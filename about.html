            <h1>About Asiris</h1>
            <p>
                Asiris, whose real name is Luke Simpson, is a rising artist in
                the contemporary pop and gospel scene. Born and raised in Texas,
                he began composing music at the age of thirteen and has been
                driven by his passion for both music and faith. Though he does
                not exclusively label his work as "Christian music," his lyrics
                often incorporate his spiritual journey and belief in God's
                guidance.

                balance his career with studies in business and marketing,
                showcasing his dedication both as an artist and a student.
